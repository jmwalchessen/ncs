## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(SpatialExtremes)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
number_of_replicates <- 10
n.size <- 1024
nn <- sqrt(n.size)
x <- y <- seq(-10, 10, length = nn)
coord <- expand.grid(x, y)
range <- 1
smooth <- 1
a <- rmaxstab(n = number_of_replicates, coord = coord, cov.mod = "powexp", nugget = 0, range = range, smooth = smooth)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
